Threads Priorities :

    1) jiski priority jyada hogi use processor pahale allocate hoga and jiski kam hogi usko processor bad mein allocate hoga.
    agar priority same hogi to JVM decide karega kisko pahale processor allocate karna hai.

    2) JVM provides the priority to each thread and according to these priorities JVM allocates the processor.

    3) Priorities are represented in the form of integer value which range from 1 to 10.
        1 -> MIN_PRIORITY
        5 -> NORM_PRIORITY
        10 -> MAX_PRIORITY

    4) Methods : 
        1. public final void serPriority(int value)
        2. public final int getPriority();

    5) The default priority of main thread is 5

    6) Nature default : Priorities are inherited from parent thread.

    7) If priority value is not between 1 to 10 then it will throw run time exception i.e. IllegalArgumentException

    8) Priority depends on the platform (windows does not support priorities).
