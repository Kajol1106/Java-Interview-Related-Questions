1) What is the J2EE, list out some of the Application Server names.

ans.============================================================

J2EE is a short form of Java 2 Enterprise Edition, formerly known as Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition

 J2EE provides a set of services that are built-in a very large scale, multi-tier, component-based, distributed

 Usually, J2EE is a set of APIs that helps in building large-scale applications. 

 J2EE Technology not only uses the APIs but also it is a standard for building and deploying enterprise applications.

 it promises “write once, run anywhere”.

 Java Enterprise Edition includes several specifications that serve various purposes like generating web pages, 
 reading and writing from the database, managing distributed queues.

 Names : 
 1) Java Servelet
 2) JSP (Java Server Pages)
 3) EJB (Enterprise Java Bean)
 4) JTA (Java Transaction API)
 5) JCA (J2EE Connector Architecture)






2) What is the difference between an Application Server and a Web server?

ans.=========================================================================

Here are some important differences between Web Server and Application Server:

Application Server :
1) An application server is a sever type that helps you to host applications.
2) It exposes business logic to the clients, which generates dynamic content.
3) Superset of a web server.
4) Application servers use for text document generation for the computation on provided data.
5) The client-side application is need to continuous data exchange between the application server and client application.
6) The application server offers an ambiance to expose the functionality of the software installed at the server-side to the clients.
7) Application servers are accessed using APIs.
8) The result is XML, JSON, and HTML, etc. files that contain required data and can serve a special purpose depending upon the user’s needs.
9) The application server delivers dynamic content.
10) Reduces web traffic, which is not resource-intensive.
11) The application server utilizes more resources.
12) The application server supports HTTP and RPC/RMI protocols.
13) The application server helps you to serve web-based applications as well as enterprise-based applications.
14) Assist Application server services such as transaction support, connection pooling, object pooling.
15) Application server assists multithreading and distributed transactions.
16) Application server can also serve HTTP content. However, it is also assists protocol like RMI/RPC.
17) The application server gives an environment to run the web with enterprise applications.


Web Server : 
1) Web Server is a computer program or a computer that runs the application.
2) It is responsible for accepting HTTP requests from clients and serving back that HTTP responses.
3) Subset of the application server.
4) Web servers are used for producing produce static or dynamic, hypertext documents.
5) Web servers need a web browser to display the result of the HTTP request. This is commonly known as an HTTP response.
6) It provides an environment for server-side programs to execute and produce HTTP response in results.
7) Web servers are accessed using HTTP request and HTTP protocols.
8) The result is a hypertext document storing the information which is displayed to the user on a web browser.
9) The web server delivers static content.
10) Reduces longer running processes that are resource-intensive.
11) Web server consumes fewer resources like CPU memory compared with the application server.
12) The web server supports HTTP Protocol.
13) Web server enables to serve web-based applications.
14) Web servers support scripting languages like PHP, Perl, JSP, ASP, etc.
15) The web server does not support multithreading.
16) Web servers are primarily designed to serve HTTP content.
17) It provides an environment to run a web application.





3) What are the challenges of developing an Enterprise application?

ans.==============================================================

The main challenges that you will have to face with Enterprise App Development are:

1. Changing Environments and Business Requirements

Sometimes, the environment of the business might change completely. The changes can be in the form of economic disruptions or 
technological changes. Based on the feedback and data analysis, the way the company works may change too. 
This means that new requirements have to be set and new workflows have to be implemented.

In some cases, there can be acquisition or merger taking place at organization level. At such situations, 
it is not easy to merge both the businesses into one and come up with an individual enterprise application which works for both.

Such applications are complex in nature and so when you attempt to make change in one requirement, it can have direct 
effect on another one. You can predict such changes quickly but by having a scalable and flexible architecture is very crucial.

Tip: When you make use of modular architecture then any changes made to a single module is not going to affect other modules 
and will not alter their functioning. This will save you a lot of development time that would be otherwise spent on making 
corrections.


2. Moving to Mobile Platform

Today more number of enterprise applications is planning to turn mobile. The demand of enterprise mobility is increasing every 
year. Compared to desktop solutions, mobility and cloud computing is moving ahead quickly and if your company does not offer 
such application services, it might lose its relevance. Mobility can help with faster decision-making and can boost productivity.

Customers as well as employees like mobility solutions and so it has turned to be more of a necessity today. Moving to mobile 
platform can be a quick decision to make but the challenge here is to make the transition as smooth as possible. You don’t want 
to have a heavy mobile application developed and also ensure all the important functionalities are included in there.

Tip: Creating right experience for the mobile users is very important. You need to check the layout properly to ensure that it 
fits in properly with the mobile format.


3. Security

Security is a very important point to consider when developing mobile applications and this means securing the resources and 
controlling user access. Enterprise application comes with a number of services like Business Process Services, 
Operating System Services, User-Interface Services, etc. and by controlling user access, you will be able to set authorized 
users for such services.

For any application having a strong defence system in place is important and this should be applied at network and host level, 
including firewalls and encryptions. For any company, enterprise data is very important. For the same, install right security 
software in your application and ensure your data is completely protected.

Your cloud-based software and mobile applications are more prone to cyber-attacks because of the increased vulnerabilities that
come through different networks. You need to be sure that the security software you are using is capable enough to handle things.
 Necessary security patches should be updated regularly within the software and it should be implemented across all the platforms.


Tip: It is important to conduct application vulnerability test on regular basis and it should be assessed. Such tests will 
look for loopholes in the software where the hackers can attack the software. You need to be sure that everything is secure 
and under control.


4. Big Data

Today data is getting collected at a great speed. Large volumes of data are getting accumulated in enterprise applications and 
the main challenge they face is to manage the data efficiently. Again, large volumes of data means increased data centre costs, 
storage costs, network costs, etc. for the enterprises, and slow loading speed of the application for the users which compromises
their experience.

It would be better that you make use of Hadoop like Big Data platforms to move your inactive data as they offer affordable 
storage, security and maintenance. You can always keep your active data on Tier-I infrastructure; however it is quite expensive 
compared to the former option.

Tip: You need to be sure about the kind of the big data application (cloud-based or on-premise), you will be choosing for your 
project.


5. Changing Technology

Change is inevitable. Enterprise applications have been changed by cloud computing models and traditional delivery models are 
replaced by Software as a Service(SaaS) today. The technology which is relevant today may turn to be obsolete tomorrow. 
When developing enterprise application, you need to be sure that it is future-proof and should not go through changes often.

Including technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be a great move as more number of businesses are identifying its 
potential and implementing it. Opting for a modular architecture will make it safe and quick to upgrade your application based 
on technology changes.

Tip: Stay close with the latest trends and technologies in the market. Get insights from them and build a strategy to be ahead 
in the game.




4) Explain how the Spring framework evolves.

ans.=====================================================

The Spring Framework was first released in 2004. After that there has been a significant major revision, 
such as Spring 2.0 provided XML namespaces and AspectJ support, Spring 2.5 provide annotation-driven configuration, 
Spring 3.0 provided a Java-based @Configuration model. The latest release of the spring framework is 4.0. it is 
released with the support for Java 8 and Java EE 7 technologies. Though you can still use Spring with an older version of java,
 the minimum requirement is restricted to Java SE 6. Spring 4.0 also supports Java EE 7 technologies, such as java message 
 service (JMS) 2.0, java persistence API (JPA) 2.1, Bean validation 1.1, servlet 3.1, and JCache.
