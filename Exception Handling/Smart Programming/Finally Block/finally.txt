Finally Block :

Finally block is a block which is followed by the try and catch block. This block will always gets executed whether 
any exception occur or not. The finally block has important code like closing connection code or stream etc.

Flow of finally block example :
 try {
    //file open code;
    //read/write code;
 } catch (Exception e) {
    //handling code or statement
 }
 finally {
    // cleanup code 
 }

 - If any exception occure then first try block will execute then catch block will execute then after that 
 finally block will execute.
 - when no exception occure finally block will execute directyly afterr try block and catch block will not execute.


 Certain points about finally block :
    - We can use multiple catch blocks with one try block but we can only use single finally block with one 
    try block, not multiple.
    - The statements present in the finally block execute even if the try block contains control transfer statements
    (i.e. jump statements break or return) like return, break or continue.


The possibilities that disturbs the execution of finally block like 
    - Using of the System.exit() method.
    - Causing a fatal errror that causes the process to abort.
    - The death of a thread.
    - Due to an exception arising in finally block.
