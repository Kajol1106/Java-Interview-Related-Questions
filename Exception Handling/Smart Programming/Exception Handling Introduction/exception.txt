Exception Handling in Java : 
============================

    introduction : 
        An Exception is an unwanted or unexpected event which occurs during the execution of 
    program. Means at the run time it disturupts the normal flow of the exection of program's instructions.
    Whenever there is exception, the method in which exception occurs will create an object and 
    that object will store three things :
    1) Exception name
    2) Description
    3) Stack Trace

    Exception Handling :
        It is an mechanisam of handling the exception or using an alternative method to continue
    the flow of execution without any disturbance is called as the Exception handling.

    Example : 
        Suppose that we have to reach at the institue daily by time. We prefer to reach the 
    institute by using bike. Then this become an normal flow of reaching at the institue. But
    one day bike's tire got punctured due to that we are not able to reach institue by time.
    This is called the exception. Which disrupts the normal flow. For this we should find out 
    an alternative way to reach at the institue. That is called as the exception handling.
