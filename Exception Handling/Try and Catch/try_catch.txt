Defination : Java exception handling is managed by using five keywords 
    1) try 
    2) catch
    3) finally
    4) throw
    5) throws 

==================================

Explain try catch.

    - try is an block which contains the code which can throw exception.
    - try block contatin the risky code which cause error in program.
    - catch block contains the exception handling code.
    - catch clause gets the exception as the parameter.
    - try and catch blocks works in pair.
    - we can use more than one catch block at a time.

    Control flow of try and catch :
    - when we user try and catch then program flow from top to bottom.
    - If there is any exception in try block then the rest of the statements of try block will not executed.
    - If there is no exception in program then catch block statements will not executed.
