Daemon Thread :
    (dusare thread ke background mein run hote hai and other thread ko service provide karate hai)

    1) Defination : Which thread run in the background of another thread thatthread is called as daemon thread

    2) Use : It provides service to the other threads.

    3) Example : Garbage collector, finalizer, Attach Listener, signale dispatcher, spelling checker
        (garbage collector main thread ko memory full ho gai to waste object ko delete karake memory provide karata hai).

    4) Methods :
        1. public final void setDaemon(boolean b)
        2. public final boolean isDaemon()

    5) Program : 
public class DaemonThread extends Thread {
	@Override
	public void run() {
//		if(Thread.currentThread().isDaemon()) {
//			System.out.println("Daemon thread...");
//		}
//		else {
//			System.out.println("Child thread(not daemon thread) ...");
//		}
		
		System.out.println("daemon thread...");
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		//Thread.currentThread().setDaemon(true);	//it's not possible. It will throw error
		//because main thread already started the thread. It will trow exception illegal
		
		System.out.println("Main thread ...");
		
		DaemonThread t1 = new DaemonThread();
		t1.setDaemon(true);
		t1.start();

	}

}

        case-1 : we have to create Daemon thread before starting the thread 
        If we create Daemon thread after starting it, it will throw 
        run time exception i.e. IllegalThreadException

        case-2 : we cannot create main thread as Daemon thread.

    6) Life : It's life depend on another thread.

    7) Nature or Properties : It inherits the properties from his parent thread.

    8) JVM role in Daemon Thread :
        sab thread run hokar dead state mein chale gai and wahan par agar daemon thread hoga to JVM us thread ko kill or dead state mein 
        lekar jayega and shut down ho jayega.

    9) Most of the times, Daemon threads has low priority but we can change it's priority according to our need.
