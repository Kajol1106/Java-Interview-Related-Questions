Variables in Java :
====================

Defn :
------
    A variable is the name of memory location that can contain data. A variable thus has a data type. ex., int a = 10;

Types of Variable :
===================
1) Local Variable :
-------------------
- Declaration : It is declared inside the bodey of the methods, constructors or blocks.
- Scope : it can be used inside methods constructors or blocks nut ot outside.
- When Variable gets memory allocated : It gets allocated when methods, constructors or blocks gets executed. Also when
    gets exists (block execution completed), local variable get destroyed.
- Stored memory : it's stored in Stack memory.
- Default values : It does not have any default values, value should be provided before use.
- Access specifier : cannot be used with local variables.

1) Instance Variable :
-------------------
- Declaration : It is declared inside the class but outside the methods, constructors or blocks.
- Scope : it can be used inside all methods, blocks and constructors within the class (not inside the static method directly).
- When Variable gets memory allocated : It gets allocated when the object is created, when objects gets destroyed variable releases memory.
- Stored memory : it's stored in Heap memory.
- Default values : It's have the default values like int=0, boolean=false, object=null etc.
- Access specifier : can be used (private, public, protected)
- How to access : this variables can be called directly or by using object name.

1) Static Variable :
-------------------
- Defn : A variable which is declared as static is called static variable. It cannot be local. You can create a single
                     copy of static variable and share among all the instances of the class. Memory allocation for static variable happends only once when the
                     class is loaded in the memory.
- Declaration : it;s declared with static keyword inside the class but outside the body of the methods, constructors or blocks.
- Scope : it can be used inside all methods, constructors or blocks including static methods, constructors or blocks..
- When Variable gets memory allocated : When we run the program and .class file is loaded in JVM, static valible gets allocated.
when class file gets unloaded from JVM, static variables gets destroyed.
- Stored memory : it's stored in non-heap memory or static memory.
- Default values : It's have the default values like int=0, boolean=false, object=null etc.
- Access specifier : can be used (private, public, protected)
- How to access : It can be called three ways
i) can be called directly
ii) by using class name i.e. Test.b
iii) by using object reference name.


Example :
public class VariablesDemo {
    int a = 100;        // it is instance variable
    static int b = 10;      //it is static variable
    void add() {
        int c = 30, d;      //c and d are local variables
        d = a+b+c;
        System.out.println(d);
    }

    void multiplication() {
        int e = 40, res;
        //res = a*b*c*e;      //this line give you compile time error because we trying to access other method variable
        res = a * b * e;
        System.out.println(e);
    }
}
