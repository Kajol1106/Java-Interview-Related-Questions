Operators in Java :
=====================

Defn : Operators are the special symbols which perform any operation on one or more operands.

Types :
i) Arithmetic : It is used in mathematical expression in the same way that they are used in algebra.
ii) Assignment : It is most common used operator in java. It evaluates the operand on the right hand side and
then assigns the resulting value to a variable on the left hands side. The right operand can be a variable, constant, function
call or expression. The type of right operand must be type of compatable with the left operand.
iii) Relational : It compares two values and determines the relationship between them.
iv) Logical : A logical operator is an operator that return a boolean result tha's based on the boolean result of one or two
other expressions.
v) Bitwise : This operator operates on individual bits of integer types(long, int, short, byte). If an operand is shorter thatn int
it is promoted to int before doing the operations. It helps to know how integers are represented in binary. For example the decimal
number 3 is represented as 11 in binary and the decimal number 5 is represented 101 in binary.
vi) Ternary : It is used as one liner replacement for if-then-else statement. It is the only conditional operator which takes three
operands and hnce the named ternary.
syntax : conditions ? if true : if false
ex.,
void add() {
        int a =10, b=20 , c = 90;
        int res = (a>b) ? a: b;
        int res2 = (a>b) ? (a>c) ? a : c : (b>c) ? b : c;
        System.out.println(res);
}
